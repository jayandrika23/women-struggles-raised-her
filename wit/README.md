## Short description

### What's the problem?

Women in several rural areas experience many difficulties in harassments, gender inequalities, denial of education, etc. which becomes unnoticed. This problem faced by major part of the women has to be destroyed in the initial stages. The government has established several rules to secure women from these inhuman activities. However these rules did not reach everywhere. Our motto is to propose a solution to the problem in order to encourage every women to come forward and fight for their independence and integrity.

### How can technology help?

The technology helps in the way that makes women to collaborate and solve their issues boldly. It provides guidance in their tough times and enhance their life in every possible way.

### The idea

Our aim is to develop a website that helps women to communicate about the issues faced by them and solve it in a efficient and personal way. It also includes allocating sessions to them whenever in need of counselling. This helps to save them from loneliness and ensures that there is a solution to each and every problem. This solution also helps creating optimistic way of life for  the women deprived of education, equality and other basic human rights.
